### [A/B Testing Case Study: Agent Dashboard Optimization](https://github.com/OlenaKryvoviaz/Portfolio/blob/main/Case%20Studies/AB_test_agents_account.md)
<br> 
Key agent engagement metrics were analyzed to test whether automation and visual insights improved activity.
<br>
<li>Measured the number of new leads introduced.</li>

<li>Compared engagement and session duration across groups.</li>

<li>Assessed invoice download adoption.</li>

<br> Project Workflow: 
<ol type="1">
  <br>
<li><strong>Data Preparation</strong>: Generated a synthetic dataset of 300 agents split across Base, V1, and V2.</li>
 <br>
<li><strong>Experiment Design:</strong>
<br> - Base = control group.
<br> - V1 = added automatic invoice generation.
<br> - V2 = invoice generation + performance visualizations.</li>
 <br>
<li><strong>Analysis</strong>: Used SQL to calculate lead growth, invoice download percentages, correlations between engagement/session and leads (Link to SQL queries).</li>
<br>
<li><strong>Reporting</strong>: Documented results and summarized findings in a structured <a href="https://github.com/OlenaKryvoviaz/Portfolio/blob/main/Case%20Studies/AB_test_agents_account.md">case study</a>.</li>

### [Tableau Dashboard: Sales and Retention analysis](https://public.tableau.com/views/OlenaKryvoviazSalesandRetentionAnalysis/SalesandRetentionAnalysis?:language=en-US&:sid=&:redirect=auth&:display_count=n&:origin=viz_share_link)



Key sales and retention metrics were analyzed to highlight strengths and weaknesses and inform the growth strategy. 
<br>- Calculated Month-1, Month-2, and Month-3 retention rates for product users.
<br>- Segmented results by country.
<br>- Computed the average purchase value.
<br>- Calculated the average number of purchases per month.
<br>- Compiled actionable recommendations.
 
<br> Project Workflow: 

<br> <strong> 1. Data Cleaning </strong>: Identified outliers and validated value ranges for every column.
<br> <strong> 2. Data Processing and Calculation </strong>: Used SQL to calculate monthly retention by region ([Link to SQL queries](https://github.com/OlenaKryvoviaz/Portfolio/blob/main/SQL/Retention%20by%20Region.sql)), average purchase value, and monthly purchase frequency by region ([Link to SQL queries](https://github.com/OlenaKryvoviaz/Portfolio/blob/main/SQL/Av_Check_and_Purchases_per_Region.sql)).
<br> <strong> 3. Visualization </strong>: Built an interactive Tableau dashboard. Heatmaps and filters make the insights easy to explore.
<br> <strong> 4. Reporting: </strong> Documented insights and next steps.

<br> Conclusion:

Recommendations vary by region. Notable insights include:

<br> <strong>Latin America.</strong> Purchase frequency and average order value are strong, but the user base is small. Identify key success factors in this market and scale acquisition efforts.
<br> <strong>Eastern Europe</strong> has the highest average order value and strong retention. Focus on increasing purchase frequency through personalized promotions, loyalty programs, cross-sell and upsell offers, remarketing, push and email reminders, subscriptions or auto-refill, and gamification. Additional research is recommended to prioritize these initiatives.
<br> <strong>East Asia</strong> boasts the best retention, but average order value and purchase frequency are middling. Enhance the product offer—upsell and bundle deals, free-shipping thresholds, premium product versions, loyalty-program bonuses for larger baskets, personalized recommendations, and limited-time discounts on higher-end products.
