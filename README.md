### [A/B Testing Case Study: Agent Dashboard Optimization](https://github.com/OlenaKryvoviaz/Portfolio/blob/main/Case%20Studies/AB_test_agents_account.md)
<br> 
Key agent engagement metrics were analyzed to test whether automation and visual insights improved activity.
<br>
<li>Measured the number of new leads introduced.</li>

<li>Compared engagement and session duration across groups.</li>

<li>Assessed invoice download adoption.</li>

<br> <strong>Project Workflow</strong>: 
<ol type="1">
  <br>
<li><strong>Problem & Hypothesis</strong>: Agent interviews revealed challenges with manual commission tracking and poor visibility into lead status. We hypothesized that automation and visual insights would increase engagement and lead generation.</li>
 <br>
<li><strong>Experiment Design:</strong>Tested three variants – Base (original), V1 (automatic invoices), V2 (invoices + interactive performance graphs)..</li>
 <br>
<li><strong>Data & Analysis</strong>: Split agents into groups and measured leads introduced, invoice downloads, engagement, and session duration. SQL queries were used for comparisons and correlations.</li>
<br>
<li><strong>Reporting</strong>: Results were consolidated into a <a href="https://github.com/OlenaKryvoviaz/Portfolio/blob/main/Case%20Studies/AB_test_agents_account.md">case study</a> highlighting key findings and recommendations for scaling.</li>

</ol>

<br> <strong>Conclusion</strong>:

<li>V1 showed <strong>+7% more leads</strong>, mainly due to improved invoice tracking</li>.

<li>V2 showed <strong>+19% more leads</strong>, with significant increases in engagement and session duration</li>.

<li>Correlations confirmed that both engagement and session duration are strongly linked to lead generation</li>.

### [Tableau Dashboard: Sales and Retention analysis](https://public.tableau.com/views/OlenaKryvoviazSalesandRetentionAnalysis/SalesandRetentionAnalysis?:language=en-US&:sid=&:redirect=auth&:display_count=n&:origin=viz_share_link)



Key sales and retention metrics were analyzed to highlight strengths and weaknesses and inform the growth strategy. 
<br>- Calculated Month-1, Month-2, and Month-3 retention rates for product users.
<br>- Segmented results by country.
<br>- Computed the average purchase value.
<br>- Calculated the average number of purchases per month.
<br>- Compiled actionable recommendations.
 
<br> <strong>Project Workflow</strong>: 

<br> <strong> 1. Data Cleaning </strong>: Identified outliers and validated value ranges for every column.
<br> <strong> 2. Data Processing and Calculation </strong>: Used SQL to calculate monthly retention by region ([Link to SQL queries](https://github.com/OlenaKryvoviaz/Portfolio/blob/main/SQL/Retention%20by%20Region.sql)), average purchase value, and monthly purchase frequency by region ([Link to SQL queries](https://github.com/OlenaKryvoviaz/Portfolio/blob/main/SQL/Av_Check_and_Purchases_per_Region.sql)).
<br> <strong> 3. Visualization </strong>: Built an interactive Tableau dashboard. Heatmaps and filters make the insights easy to explore.
<br> <strong> 4. Reporting: </strong> Documented insights and next steps.

<br> <strong>Conclusion</strong>:

Recommendations vary by region. Notable insights include:

<br> - Latin America. Purchase frequency and average order value are strong, but the user base is small. Identify key success factors in this market and scale acquisition efforts.
<br> - Eastern Europe has the highest average order value and strong retention. Focus on increasing purchase frequency through personalized promotions, loyalty programs, cross-sell and upsell offers, remarketing, push and email reminders, subscriptions or auto-refill, and gamification. Additional research is recommended to prioritize these initiatives.
<br> - East Asia boasts the best retention, but average order value and purchase frequency are middling. Enhance the product offer—upsell and bundle deals, free-shipping thresholds, premium product versions, loyalty-program bonuses for larger baskets, personalized recommendations, and limited-time discounts on higher-end products.

<br> <strong>Key Skills</strong>:
