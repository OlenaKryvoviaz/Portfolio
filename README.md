# MY PAST PROJECTS

### [Tableau Dashboard: Sales and Retention analysis](https://public.tableau.com/views/OlenaKryvoviazSalesandRetentionAnalysis/SalesandRetentionAnalysis?:language=en-US&:sid=&:redirect=auth&:display_count=n&:origin=viz_share_link)

<em> 
The main sales and retention metrics were analyzed to identify weak and strong points for building a further growth strategy. 
- Calculated Retention Rate for Month 1, Month 2, and Month 3 of the product users.
- Divided this data by country.
- Calculated average purchase check.
- Calculated the average amount of purchases per month.
- Built a recommendation list.
 
<br> Project Workflow: 

<br> <strong> 1. Data Cleaning </strong>: Finding outliers and value ranges for each column.
<br> <strong> 2. Data Processing and Calculation </strong>: Utilizing SQL for calculations: monthly retention derived by region ([Link to SQL queries](https://github.com/OlenaKryvoviaz/Portfolio/blob/main/SQL/Retention%20by%20Region.sql)), average check, and average purchases per month derived by region ([Link to SQL queries](https://github.com/OlenaKryvoviaz/Portfolio/blob/main/SQL/Av_Check_and_Purchases_per_Region.sql)).
<br> <strong> 3. Visualization </strong>: Using Tableau, I created a dashboard that visualizes all the data. Heatmap and filters help to interpret the data better.
<br> <strong> 4. Reporting: </strong>

<br> Conclusion:

Recommendations vary from region to region. Here are some of them:

<br> <strong>Latin America.</strong> Here is a very good frequency of purchases, a good average check, but the number of users is small. You need to determine the success point for users in this market and try to scale.
<br> <strong>Eastern Europe</strong> showed the highest average check and very good retention. Here, it is worth working on the frequency of purchases. Personalized promotions, loyalty programs, cross-sell and upsell offers, remarketing, push and email reminders, subscriptions or auto-refill, gamification - these are the options that can be used, but first I would conduct additional research.
<br> <strong>East Asia</strong> has the highest retention, but a rather mediocre average check and the number of purchases per month. Here it is worth working on the product offer - upsell and bundle offers, a minimum amount for free shipping, premium versions of products, loyalty programs with bonuses for larger checks, personalized recommendations, limited-time discounts on more expensive products.

<br> Key Skills:

<br>SQL
