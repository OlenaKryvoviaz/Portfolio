# Portfolio

Hello everyone! My name is Olena Kryvoviaz.

I’m a Product Manager with a strong background in marketing and a passion for building customer-centric digital products. My experience spans across Israeli and European PropTech and startup ecosystems, where I’ve led cross-functional teams and managed products from ideation to launch and growth. I’m especially driven by product discovery, data-informed decision-making, and continuous product improvement. Feel free to explore my portfolio to get a sense of my skills through example projects based on case studies and open-source data.
